# Quran-For-My-Android


Assalamu 'Alaikum.

Quran For My Android" is a simple app that displays Quran text or word by word translation.

This was intended to be used for learning the translations of 'Quranic words' And thus understanding the Quran and at the same time accelerating learning arabic.

All word by word transliteration, meanings were collected from <b>http://corpus.quran.com/wordbyword.jsp</b> which is "an annotated linguistic resource which shows the Arabic grammar, syntax and morphology for each word in the Holy Quran."

English translation follows the translation by Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali and Muhammad Muhsin Khan (collected from http://tanzil.net/trans/)
